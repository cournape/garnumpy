    - fetch from SVN instead of release as option
    - test target
    - sync env values in startgarnumpy and in gar.conf.mk
    - better handling of compiler specific stuff (fortan and C) (clean up the
      whole main_CC vs CC vs ... mess)
    - -fno-f2c ? Use it or not with g77 ? For Atlas, set the fortran compiler
      to same value than NETLIB
    - having a serie of sensible default for compilers. For example, one set
      for gcc/g77, one for ICC, etc...)

Values to modifify:
    - python version in startnumpy.sh
    - SCIPYSANDPKG: a string of list of scipy packages to enable
    - by default: 

For ubuntu (edgy at least):
    - numpy:
        - gcc
        - g++
        - gfortran
        - python
        - atlas3-base-dev
    - mpl:
        - python-gtk2-dev

Important points:
    - by default, build blas/lapack
    - check fortran compiler options by
    - do NOT use make -j N (should have some variable somewhere 
      to speed up compilation when it is safe, though)
