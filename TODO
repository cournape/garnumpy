    - Clean umfpack mess: the makefile are a mess, we should replace it with
      our own Makefile (taking them from debian pkg ?)
    - for now, only CC=gcc and F77=g77 works, on ubuntu edgy:
      test on FC (6 ?) with gcc, and ubuntu + intel compilers at least.
    - the above means separate compiler specific mess 
    - having a serie of sensible default for compilers. For example, one set
      for gcc/g77, one for ICC, etc...)
    - fetch from SVN instead of release as option
    - sync env values in startgarnumpy and in gar.conf.mk
    - -fno-f2c ? Use it or not with g77 ? For Atlas, set the fortran compiler
      to same value than NETLIB

Important points:
    - by default, build blas/lapack
    - check fortran compiler options by
    - do NOT use make -j N (should have some variable somewhere 
      to speed up compilation when it is safe, though)
